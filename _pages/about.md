I am an PhD student at Swinburne University of Technology and CSIRO's Data61. 


My research interests focus on the area of Cybersecurity and AI, which covers trustworthy and responsible AI and adversarial machine learning.

I also serve as a reviewer for international conferences/journals like ACM MM’24, NeurIPS’24, ICML’24, IEEE TDSC, IEEE TIFS, and ACM Computing Survey. 

I am open to collaboration on AI security. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in working together. [Schedule the meeting with me](https://calendly.com/mark941101/30min)


My Working Principles
======
- I typically work at least 10 hours a day, except when I intentionally take time off.

- I believe in making thoughtful choices and committing to them fully.

- Publishing is not the bottleneck—papers are relatively easy to produce and will eventually be published.

- I prioritize long-term research impact over short-term publication wins.

- Projects I lead generally demand significant effort, often sufficient to be split into multiple papers (though I often choose not to).

- As a generalist, I'm open to exploring new research directions, depending on my current bandwidth.
